## About me

I'm a heavily right-brained person who's unfortunately very into Digital Revolution. Since my career path has been killed, I've decided to devote my time to learning Python and Processing. 


## Open Source is great

I forked the Hyde, a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme, to create this blog. I have been trying to build and decorate my blog with an excessive amount of stack overflow browsing. 

## License
