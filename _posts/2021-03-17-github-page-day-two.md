### Github page: day 2

<div class="message">
  (FUCKING HELL you spend hours on one error but it just suddenly works.)
</div>

Spent some time understanding what is going on in this template I forked. I'm a fork girl myself.
Added social media buttons. 
Tomorrow I'll add a 'read-more' button on blog post then I think I can really go back to learning python.
