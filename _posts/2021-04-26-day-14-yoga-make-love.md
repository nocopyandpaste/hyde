### Yoga is to make love to yourself.

<p>No. Not masturbating. </p>

<p>I have to first admit I’m just as basic as people I judge - I searched ‘yoga lost weight’ on reddit earlier today, and I saw someone says ‘The goal of yoga isn’t losing weight, but your relationship with your body will be completely transformed.’ It hits me pretty hard as a year ago I wouldn’t appreciate myself for just a tiny bit of effort I made but instead I’d be judging myself for not achieving more. </p>

<p>To say ‘trained’ is a bit strong, but yoga has been teaching me to review my relationship with myself, to listen to my own body, and to breath the moment. I feel pain therefore I exist. Every tendon and muscle being torn and ripped apart is a reminder of how I try to live a little better, therefore, the will to live which I’ve been lacking.</p>

<p>I got a haircut yesterday and I now look like a lady who has a high diploma from the institutions where most cops got their diploma from because she couldn’t get into university and now works as a clerk and thinks girls who have had more than two sexual partners are sluts. I used to look like the slut. But it’s a lesson I’ve learnt - don’t get bangs and don’t get layered hair. So I’ve learnt something and it’s good. </p>

<p>Life is all about learning, if you’re a loser, which I’m one. Indeed I had dreams, I wanted to write a damn novel, write a damn play, make a damn film, get damn famous. But at some point in life where some people would call growing up, I had realised even I achieve all these goals, there is only one Kafka and one Kubrick. And there is no fucking way I am them nor the next them, so what is the point? As a result, I’ve officially given up on being a Kafka, I’m just going to 1) do things I enjoy doing, 2) be a good person and 3) to keep being a better person. So, back to my hair, I’ve learn something about my hair today. And so it’s positive. </p>

<p>But for sure, losing a few pounds as a side effect would be great too.<br>

<br>

And last but not least, this is day fourteen, counted from the day I started doing yoga regularly after ALMOST A WHOLE FUCKING YEAR on and off of trying to do more yoga HOLYSHIT I NEVER REALISED IT’S BEEN A FUCKING YEAR UNTIL I CHECKED JUST NOW. BUT I’M chill and zen now so I’m not judging myself how I’ve spent a whole year on nothing. Look now zen yoga has made me. Hooray.</p>
