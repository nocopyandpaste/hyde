### Don't have too much faith in humanity. 


><font color="red"> Disclaimer: All "coke" in this article is being referred to COCA-COLAÂ®. </font>

So, last night, I went to a tiny concert with my friend Nina. Long story short, we ended up having a drink at her co-worker's place with a friend of the co-worker, then proceeded to ordering coke.

Right. I forgot my little internal personal moral code, that all production of Coke involves human trafficking and thou shall not consume any coke, unless it's leftover that no one wants. I was tipsy, and more importantly, I can't really say I've been having the best time here in Belgium, so a little bit of stimulation in life would be good for me, and make the trip worth it, I thought.

Anyway, I confess my iniquity; I am sorry for my sin. The guy (the guy) who suggested picking up coke had on cash on him and asked if anyone did. I did. So I offered to pay in cash and he will pay me back.

THEN HE ASKs, 'Do you have Bitcoin?' You should have seen my twinkled eyes, I felt nearly the most excited since I landed. Finally someone who is intelligent enough to know what blockchain is, which is not exactly that high of a  threshold. After SO. FUCKING. MANY. cocooned privileged ignorant apolitical Belgians. So I went, FUCK YES! 

While waiting for our coke, we chatted about blockchain, to be accurate, how amazing blockchain and putting blockchain into use, is, which he constantly agreed. And he reminded me again to send him my Bitcoin address.

The next day, he texted:
>Haha. What do you mean?

Well, I thought, the guy might be too drunk to remember a thing? Damn man, I suck at telling people to pay me back. Please don't make me do it, god. I'm sinful. I'll wait for a bit to reply and perhaps he will remember. 


Then he texted Nina:
> I want to pay Stacey back but she sent me a bunch of bitcoin language I don't understand

This is the moment of my awakening. The "do you have bitcoin' was a joke and he was being sarcastic because ***<font color="green">'CRiMiNalS uSE bItcoIn, leTS go TO THe DARknET"</font>*** 

IT WAS A FUCKING JOKE!!!!!
