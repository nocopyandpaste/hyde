### Revolution is not a dinner party.


    First they came for the Uyghurs, and I did not speak out — 
    Because I was not a Uyghur.
     
    Then they came for Hong Kong, and I did not speak out — 
    Because I was not a Hongkonger.
    
    Then they came for the Hans — and there was no one left to speak for me.

It's been more than 24 hours since the breakout of the protests in China. Here's a sarcasm I'm too scared to share publicly - they built camps for the Uyghurs and started a genocide because the Uyghurs started an uprising, so when is the CCP building the camp for the Hans now?   

This is hands down the biggest resilience since 1989, but this time, I can sense a loss of a totalitarian China but not the rise of a democratic China. Some, including part of myself, think this is the spark of a democracy. But most part of me is thinking, are they fighting for a greater cause or just fighting out of selfishness as they struggle to make ends meet. There is a difference between fighting for justice and fighting for needs - a big one - are they on formal operational stage or still on oral stage?

As long as Chinese don't review the nationalism in China, there won't be as much of a change - even if they overthrow the CCP - history is only going to repeat itself. The China today is a product of the pedantic and stale Confucianism, well, at least the CCP has been using it as a tool to control the people. Same as 1989, you can still see netizens saying they are standing up to create a "greater China". The problem is, after one overthrows a dictator, there will just be another dictator or system oppressing another group, if Chinese people do not rethink their Han chauvinism ideology, despite how many times they chant "freedom of speech". What China needs isn't just another leader, but another New Cultural Movement, an ideological revolution.

Every time I see an image of a crowd, or a clip of police brutality, I just wonder, have they ever thought about if they've got enough people, they can actually bury every person in power alive. There is a Cantonese idiom that says 蟻多摟死象, meaning "no end of ants kills an elephant". 

Revolution is not a dinner party, Mao said. A lot of people support the protests, at least at per my echo chamber, but how many of them really put it into action? It IS brave to fuck the government, yet words are easy. Revolution is not a dinner party. Totalitarianism is often a collective karma.

LOL. One of the funny thing I observed after an afternoon on clubhouse, is that, when Chinese people talked, it's always lengthy and long-winded. It's never on point, just like the Chinese government's speeches as usual, they NEVER get to then point. But when Hongkongers speak, they get to the point in no time - firstly, secondly, thank you, bye. That one goodbye from a Chinese girl's speech, is longer than an entire speech of a Hongkonger. It's funny, but also reveals a problem.
