<div class="message">
  ALERT: still about github page
</div>



<p>Though I said this is about making art with python. Day 3 is still about making this damn GitHub page. But more importantly I see my own improvement. So I deserve some applause from me, myself and I.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#Things I&rsquo;ve accomplished</p>
<ul>
    <li>Build the fucking site</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, &lsquo;build the site&rsquo; is too vague. How &lsquo;built&rsquo; is &lsquo;built&rsquo;? Having text on the webpage? Getting to my ideal website structure? BUTT! AT LEAST! Now this site is live and I&rsquo;m uploading content.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Brief structure</li>
</ul>
<p>I successfully removed all redundant items and post and edited the footers and etc etc. Throughout the process I have learnt more about how jekyll works.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Social media button!</li>
</ul>
<p>YAY! BIG YAY. I mean, it&rsquo;s not like I coded the whole js and it&rsquo;s just a built-in data ability, but I finally made it after a few fail attempts. Turns out I didn&rsquo;t read it through and didn&rsquo;t import the FontAwesome stylesheet. Thank you https://jreel.github.io/social-media-icons-on-jekyll/! You did a great job writing tutorial to programming illiterates like me.</p>
<p>#To-do list</p>
<ul>
    <li>Navigation</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to organise my menu bar. Sub-categories.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Preview</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want my homepage be just have every whole post laid the fuck out. I want it to show just an extract then you can click &lsquo;read more&rsquo; so that I don&rsquo;t force anyone to actually read more, I mean, not that anyone is reading my blog. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Domain</li>
</ul>
<p>I for some reason can&rsquo;t make the site work without giving it a subdomain. I actually want it to be just https://nocopyandpaste.github.io/ without that stupid pun.</p>
<p>#Problems to be fixed</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hyperlinks</li>
</ul>
<p>All the links are off and broken?? Like when I click on a post it does not take me to my post. And the whole base-url thing. I think I will need help for this.</p>
<p>-------</p>
<p>That&apos;s it for today. I finished two blog posts. And I added social media buttons. You&apos;re a GOOD GIRL.</p>
